	abstract = {A wireless ad hoc network is formed by a group of wireless hosts, without the use of any infrastructure. To enable communication, hosts cooperate among themselves to forward packets on behalf of each other. A key challenge in ad hoc networks lies in designing efficient routing strategies. While several routing protocols have been proposed, most of them aim to select one optimal route between the source and destination. The MAC layer at each intermediate node is then required to forward packets to the next downstream node on that route. We argue that choosing a single optimal route at the network layer may not be sufficient. Knowledge of short-term channel conditions at the MAC layer can play an important role in improving end-to-end performance. Instantaneous interference, channel contention, power constraints and other considerations may be taken into account along with the network layer's long-term view. This paper proposes MAC layer anycasting- a forwarding strategy that combines the guidelines from the network layer, with MAC layer knowledge of the local channel. We describe some applications of MAC-layer anycasting, and discuss the performance related tradeoffs.},

	abstract = {Communication among the wireless links between mobile nodes is become popular research area because of its simplicity of deployment and mobility. Collection of all mobile nodes through which all wireless links are connected called as Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). MANET network gets too much attraction of researchers due to its mobility, reliability, self-repairing, dynamic infrastructure and independent with the help of center administration. Despite of numerous advantages it has many problems like synchronization, routing protocol, delay and shortest path. Many routing protocols have been proposed like OLSR, DSDV, DSR, AODV and TORA so far to improve the routing performance therefore these routing protocols are studied in depth and simulated using NS-2. The simulation and comparison results will briefly present the impact of network size, packet delivery ratio, average delay and average throughput.},
